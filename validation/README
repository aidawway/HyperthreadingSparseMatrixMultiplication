The validation suite validates the correctness of the SparseMatrix
Multiplication by comparing the dense matrix representation of the 
SparseMatrix product with the matlab product of the dense matrix
representation of the operand matrices.

Follow the instructions to build and run the validation suite.

1. Run buildValidationTests. This will create several random
	sparseMatrices, their product, and the dense matrix 
	representations of them.

2. Run runValidationTests. This will run the 
	validateProductMatrix MatLab script
	on all of the built data and print
	the results
