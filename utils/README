This folder contains helper scripts and source files for various purposes

Make all will make 3 executables: generateCSRMatrix, multiplyMatricesRunner, 
and parseDenseMatrix.

generateCSRMatrix(char* outputFile, int n, int nnz)
	This process will generate a n by n sparse matrix in CSR format
	with nnz nonzero elements and write it to the file indicated by
	outputFile

multiplyMatricesRunner(char* input1, char* input2, char* output)
	This process will parse the SparseMatrices from the files
	indicated by input1 and input2, multiply them together, 
	and then write the product to the file indicated by output 
	in CSR format.

parseDenseMatrix(char* input)
	This process will parse the SparseMatrix from the file 
	indicated by input and print out the dense matrix 
	representation.
