This is the code for David D'Atre's Final Project Submission
for Computer Architecture

__________________________________________________________
Setup:

First, run the following command to organize this code

	./setup
___________________________________________________________
Validation:

Code to validate the accuracy of the provided sparse matrix
multiplication code can be found in the folder ./validation
___________________________________________________________
Raw Data:

To create random sparseMatrices to test on you may wish to
use the buildData script. The script buildData will create
matrices for numTests tests in folders named after 
testName. Each matrix will have matrixSize rows and 
between matrixSize and 2 * matrixSize nonzero elements. The
format expected by build data is given below.

	./buildData testName matrixSize numTests

buildData will also create two files: testName_input1.txt
and testName_input2.txt that will be used to call 
hyperthreadTest and/or singleThreadTest. 


If you wish to create your own sparse matrices then follow
the below format. 

Note that all matrices must be square
and that the data values must be doubles.

	length, nnz
	data1, data2, ...datannz,
	c1, c2, ...cnnz,
	r1, r2, ...rnnz, rf

length is the length of the dense matrix
nnz is the number of nonzero elements
data1... are the list of data values separated by a comma
c1... are the list of column indices separated by a comma
r1... are the list of row indices separated by a comma

Note: all matrices must be square
Note: the data values must be doubles
Note: it is assumed that SparseMatrix files end in .smx

_________________________________________________________
Running Tests:


hyperthreadTest expects the following format

	./hyperthreadTest input1 input2 matrixCount matrixSize output


input1 is a list of .smx files that contain the left hand SparseMatrix 
	operand data.

input2 is a list of .smx files that contain the right hand SparseMatrix
	operand data.

matrixCount is the number of .smx files in input1 and input2

matrixSize is the nummber of rows in the tested multiplications.
	This value is purely cosmetic for output.

output is the name of the file to write the timeTaken in seconds


singleThreadTest expects the same arguments as hyperthreadTest.

Note that singleThreadTest has a capital T in Thread.
